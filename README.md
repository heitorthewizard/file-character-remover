<h1>File Character Remover<h1>

<h2>This program removes any character from a file and creates a new one</h1>

<p>
Ex:
<br>
You have an HTML file and want to translate the texts in it, but
you don't want them to go with special HTML elements like "em",
"strong", etc. You simply open the program and add those key
words in it as items and it will create a new file without them
for you
